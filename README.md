# Udemy Work
This repository holds the projects I've worked/am working on while going through Udemy courses. I hope to reuse any snippets of code that prove to be useful in the future. All code in the repo was done by me however much of it comes from following tutorials. I do not clame to have designed or thought up these projects on my own. 

The following list gives the class names, professors, and udemy links to find the associated courses for the code in this repo
