This repository holds the projects I've worked/am working on while going through Udemy courses. I placed it all in one repository so I wouldn't have a bunch of them filled with udemy code. I do not claim to have thought up these projects on my own. I wrote them following tutorials and doing challenges to try out new technologies and learn more.

The following list gives the class names, professors, and Udemy links to find the associated courses for the code in this repo.

## Cloning A Section

If you ever need to clone a section use the following instructions (from stack overflow)

Create empty repo with remote, and fetch files (but don't check them out).

    mkdir <repo>
    cd <repo>
    git init
    git remote add -f origin <url>

Enable parseCheckout

    git config core.sparseCheckout true

Now define which file/folder(s) you want to check out by listing in .git/info/sparse-checkout

    echo "some/dir/" >> .git/info/sparse-checkout
    echo "another/sub/tree" >> .git/info/sparse-checkout

Lastly

    git pull origin master
